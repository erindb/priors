## Notes on priors

- what do we mean by priors?

	- simple things
	
		- one binary outcome - how likely is it?
		
		- 3 binary outcomes
		
		- scalar settings
		
		- 15 outcomes...
	
	- complicated things
	
		- a whole intuitive theory is a prior
		
		
- what do we ask people (dv)? not probabilities, because they're bad at it
	
	- give an outcome (slider, typing, binned histograms)

	- give N outcomes (imagine 10 times that you tried this, how many marbles sank?)
	
	- binned histograms with different binning strategies
	
	- scrape priors	
	
	- -> results: squishing, expanding, task re-interpretation (make points add to 100); generally: often, qualitative results are similar, very different quantitatively

- issue: 

	- we don't know how what we elicit relates to the underlying prior		
	
	- we don't have a gold standard, so it's hard to calibrate
	
- example:

	- we thouhgt sinking marbles was a case of binomials -- but that doesn't work, so we can't use it as a gold standard
	
		
- what do we need:

	- linking function between prior and response behavior
	
	- try to jointly pin down priors and parameters of linking functions
	
	- issue:
	
		- explosion of conditions (we need more data)
		
		- explosion of computational tractability
	
	
- strategies:

	- if i want to transform to predict one DV outcome from another one, what would i need to do?
	
	- ordering task, to see if it matches sliders/other DVs?
	
	- let people choose their DV themselves?
