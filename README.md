## Notes from priors meeting (5/8-9/2015)

- what do we mean by priors?

	- simple things
	
		- one binary outcome - how likely is it?
		
		- 3 binary outcomes
		
		- scalar settings
		
		- 15 outcomes...
	
	- complicated things
	
		- a whole intuitive theory is a prior
		
		
- what do we ask people (dv)? not probabilities, because they're bad at it
	
	- give an outcome (slider, typing, binned histograms)

	- give N outcomes (imagine 10 times that you tried this, how many marbles sank?)
	
	- binned histograms with different binning strategies
	
	- scrape priors	
	
	- -> results: squishing, expanding, task re-interpretation (make points add to 100); generally: often, qualitative results are similar, very different quantitatively

- issue: 

	- we don't know how what we elicit relates to the underlying prior		
	
	- we don't have a gold standard, so it's hard to calibrate
	
- example:

	- we thouhgt sinking marbles was a case of binomials -- but that doesn't work, so we can't use it as a gold standard
	
		
- what do we need:

	- linking function between prior and response behavior
	
	- try to jointly pin down priors and parameters of linking functions
	
	- issue:
	
		- explosion of conditions (we need more data)
		
		- explosion of computational tractability
	
	
- strategies:

	- if i want to transform to predict one DV outcome from another one, what would i need to do?
	
	- ordering task, to see if it matches sliders/other DVs?
	
	- let people choose their DV themselves?
	
## Results so far

### Experiment 1

http://stanford.edu/~erindb/priors/experiments/exp1/exp1.html

#### Method

20 participants. We elicited prior beliefs from each participant on 8 different items using 3 different DVs:	

- give a number -- adjust a slider that ranges between a min and max value

- binned histogram (15 bins) -- for each of 15 bins of pre-define intervals, say how likely that bin is using a slider with endpoints labeled "extremely likely" and "impossible", with intermediate labels "very likely", "neutral", "not very likely"

- lightning round -- for 5 paired comparisons (bins 0-1, 1-5, 5-10, 10-13, 13-14), say which one you think is more likely (2AFC)

Each participant saw each item in each DV, but the order of trials was randomized. Lightning rounds always occurred as a block of five trials (with order of comparisons randomized within that block).

Items were chosen from previous experiments run by Justine, Erin, Michael F., Ciyang, Anthea, and Judith:

- coffee temperatures (44F or less - 200F or more, steps of 13)

- blockbuster movie lengths (0 - 210 or more minutes, steps of 16)

- last week's TV watching durations (0 - 43 or more hours, steps of 3)

- yesterday's commute times (0 - 98 or more minutes, steps of 7)

- laptop prices (0 - more than $7500, steps of $500)

- watch prices (0 - more than $750, steps of $50)

- number of sinking marbles (0 - 14, steps of 1)

- number of kids that laughed when told a joke (0 - 14, steps of 1)

#### Results

Results for the three different DVs are shown below.
