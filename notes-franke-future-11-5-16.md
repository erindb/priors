### more tasks

compare binned-histograms with more tasks:

- Manski-task [in progress]
- iterated learning
- scoring rules
- an adaptive procedure that approximates optimal information gain [Noah]

### variations on existing tasks

- give-a-bin (direct comparison to give-a-number)
- binned-histograms with different/more/less finer-/coarser-grained bins [CogSci reviewer 1]
    - "Is it better to have regularly spaced bins? Is it (more) important that the bins follow the underlying distribution (more bins in more crowded areas)?
- rephrase instructions to elicit estimates about what subject $i$ believes about a random subject $j$'s subjective beliefs about quantity $k$; this might or might not be different from our present elicitation of subject $i$'s beliefs about quantity $k$, but it might be what matters for language use (not subjective beliefs but estimations of another speaker's beliefs) [suggested by Thomas Brochhagen]
    
### extended modeling 

- lump together answers from 2 or 3 adjacent bins -> run analysis -> any change? [CogSci reviewer 1]
- evaluate model on fake data:
    - does the model recover true latent structure that generated a fake data set?
    - does it do so, even if we vary the bins? [CogSci reviewer 1]
